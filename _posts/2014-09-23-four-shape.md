title: Four-shape note names in LilyPond
foo: More on using solfège syllables for input — potentially useful for Sacred Harp composers.
---

In [my last post on movable-do note names in LilyPond,]({% post_url 2014-09-14-movable-do %})
 I wondered whether
it would be possible to enter notes using the four syllables used in Sacred
Harp singing, where an octave is not `do re mi fa sol la ti do` but rather
`fa so la fa so la mi fa`. I guessed that the answer was no, because
LilyPond assumes that note names will repeat at the octave.

But @tychoish and @willf both pointed out that all you need is a way to *distinguish*
between the two `fa`'s, the two `so`'s and the two `la`'s in an octave.  And of
course there are plenty of ways of doing that.

 One nice way is using capitalization: LilyPond is case-sensitive, and so it's
perfectly possible for `fa` and `Fa` to represent two different pitches. This
lets us enter a C major scale as follows, without confusing the parser: `Fa` is
always the tonic, `fa` is always the fourth degree; and similarly for `So` and
`so`, or `La` and `la`; and so there is never any ambiguity.

~~~ 
\include "fasola.ly"
\fasola c' { Fa So La fa so la mi Fa }
\fasola d' { Fa So La fa so la mi Fa }
~~~
{: .language-lilypond}
{% lilypond %}
\relative c' { c d e f g a b c \key d \major d, e fis g a b cis d }
{% endlilypond %}


Here is the lilypond source code which was included (as `fasola.ly`) in that example.

fasola =
  #(define-music-function (parser location k m) ; take two real arguments: k and m.
                          (ly:pitch? ly:music?) ; k should be a pitch, m should be some music
    #{\key $k \major                            % set the key to k
      \transpose do $k { \relative $k { $m } }  % and transpose the music so that "do" is k
    #}
  )
