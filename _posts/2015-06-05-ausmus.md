Elder John R. Daily's _Primitive Baptist Hymn and Tune Book_ is a seven-shape Primitive
Baptist hymnal with a strikingly distinctive harmonic style.[^1] As I've been
singing more and more from the Daily book, I've started getting curious about
the roots of its unusual harmonies.

It turns out that many of Daily's arrangements come from a few Primitive
Baptist hymnals of the 1880s. One source is Durant &amp; Lester's 1886 _Hymn and
Tune Book,_ which Rachel Wells Hall discussed in [this blog
post.](http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2013/200-years-of-bourbon/) Another
source is Sears &amp; Ausmus's 1881 _Primitive Baptist Hymnal,_ which I haven't
seen discussed elsewhere. These sources include a number of arrangements that
were later printed in Daily. They also include some arrangements that didn't
make it into Daily, but that are written in a similar style. 

Still, Daily was not just an imitator of these earlier arrangers. The Daily
book includes some arrangements that are originals as far as I can tell, and
others that are improvements or refiniments of works from D&amp;L or S&amp;A. 

In other words, what I've come to think of as the "Daily book style" wasn't
just the work of one eccentric arranger. It was part of an ongoing tendency in
Primitive Baptist harmony. S&amp;A is the earliest source I've found for this
style, but Daily and D&amp;L were active contributors, and it is possible that
there were other authors involved too. 



## CONFLICT

The song CONFLICT, which was recently repopularized in the _Shenandoah
Harmony,_ illustrates several of the Daily book's distinctive features. Daily's
harmonies lean heavily towards major keys, and he reharmonizes many old
minor-key folk hymns with borrowings from the relative major. His arrangements
often uses `IV` chords where earlier books like the Sacred Harp would use `ii` or
`vi` — and in minor-key songs, he makes heavy use of the `IV` chord of the relative
major.[^3] His arrangement for CONFLICT ends its first and last phrases in
minor, but spends most of the rest of the song in the relative major, with
heavy use of the relative major `IV` chord.

The Better Music movement, spearheaded by Lowell Mason, also favored major keys
and traditional `I-IV-V` harmonies. But Daily's harmonies are not just a copy of
the ones favored by Mason and friends. For instance, a number of songs in the
Daily book also have what Rachel Wells Hall has called [unanswered cadences](http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2014/questioning-the-unanswered-cadence/) —
forbidden in Mason's "scientific" harmony — in which a major-key piece ends
unexpectedly on `IV`, `V` or `vi`, rather than `I`. 

Daily's own version of CONFLICT does not have an unanswered cadence. But as Rachel
Wells Hall discusses [in this
post,](http://www.shenandoahharmony.com/2013/200-years-of-bourbon/) an earlier
version in D&amp;L did have one.  In that book it was completely recast in
major, with no trace of its minor-key origins, and in order to accommodate the
last note of the tune it ended on `IV` rather than `I`.

As it turns out, this earlier version of CONFLICT did not originate with
D&amp;L. It appeared several years earlier in S&amp;A:

## OTHER SONGS

In fact, many of the harmonically adventurous arrangements from the Daily book and D&amp;L appeared in S&amp;A first.

CONQUERING SOLDIER ([S&amp;A 93](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/280),
Daily 211) is a lovely example. This arrangement, which first appeared in
S&amp;A, takes the minor-key tune which appears in the Sacred Harp as 201
PILGRIM and reharmonizes it entirely in major, resorting to an unanswered
cadence on `IV` to accommodate the last note.  For this song, Daily does not
make any significant changes to S&amp;A's arrangement. In particular, unlike in
CONFLICT, he keeps the unanswered cadence, which in my opinion is one of the
song's finest features. Here's the Sacred Harp version of the tune, harmonized in
minor:

And here's the arrangement found in S&amp;A and Daily, reharmonized in major:

Another example of these books' style is SALVATION ([S&amp;A
62](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/190), D&amp;L 189, Daily 158). It is
another minor key tune, and begins and ends on the tonic in minor, but the
second half of the tune strays into the relative major. (The high point for me
is at the end of the third line, where the 1-La is harmonized not with a `i` or
`iv` as it usually would be in the Sacred Harp, but with `IV/III`, the `IV`
chord of the relative major key.) S&amp;A and D&amp;L have nearly identical
versions; Daily has the same chord changes, but many of the details of the
parts are different.

Some other highlights from D&amp;L and Daily that seem to have originated in S&amp;A include:

- An arrangement of SOCIAL BAND that leans heavily on the relative major ([S&amp;A 10](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/29), D&amp;L 85, also in the Daily book as 262 AMBOY).
- A reharmonization of the E Dorian tune LAND OF REST in which it is treated as if it were in D Major — requiring it to end in an unanswered cadence on the V chord to accomodate the final E ([S&amp;A 150](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/410), D&amp;L 135). 
- A startling lydian-mode version of BRAY ([S&amp;A 39](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/120), D&amp;L 45), a tune which appeared in a plainer major arrangement in the Hesperian Harp (64).
- An oddly Classical-sounding major-key version of STAR IN THE EAST ([S&amp;A 185](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/478), D&amp;L 24).[^4]
- KENTUCKY ([S&amp;A 18](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/52), D&amp;L 202), a pleasant but fairly tame reharmonization of Lucius Chapin's PRIMROSE or NINETY-THIRD PSALM (SH 31).

And there are some gems in S&amp;A that weren't repeated in those later books,
including reharmonized versions of MINISTER'S FAREWELL ([S&amp;A
86](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/258)) and RESTORATION (retitled I WILL
ARISE, [S&amp;A 12](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/32)). 


## A REGIONAL TREND?


Many, though not all, of these highlights in S&amp;A are marked "Arranged by T. B. A." — almost certainly the initials of Thomas Box Ausmus, the book's second author. It is tempting to wonder if Ausmus might in fact have been the source of all of these distinctive arrangements.

But that can't be the whole story — for Daily and D&amp;L also have
reharmonizations in the same style that did not originate in S&amp;A.  This
suggests that the authors of the other books were not just copying from Ausmus,
but were participating in a larger stylistic trend along with him.

One especially dramatic example of the three books' independence from each
other is the tune IDUMEA. Each of the three books has its own version.  Sears
&amp; Ausmus ([31](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/90)) leave the melody unaltered, but reharmonize it entirely in
the relative major up until the final two bars.

> Sears and Ausmus, [page scan from Hymnary.org](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/PBH1881/90)

Daily (125) leaves the tune in
minor, though with more borrowings from the relative major than were in the
original, but he adds several chromatic alterations to the melody. Durand &amp;
Lester (177) take a similar approach to Daily, but make different choices in
reharmonizing the piece.

> Durand and Lester, [page scan from Hymnary.org](http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/HTBU1886/439)

All three arrangements seem to me like
"modernizations" of the tune in more or less the same spirit.

So these arrangements weren't just the work of a single eccentric arranger: the
authors of each book created some new arrangements of their own,[^5] followings
similar stylistic trends.  In fact, I'm tempted to wonder whether it may have
been a regional or denominational trend. The three book's authors were members
of the same faith, all worked within several decades of each other, and all
were connected in one way or another to a fairly small area surrounding Saint
Louis and Indianapolis.[^6] This could be a coincidence. (I have not looked at
Primitive Baptist hymnals of that era from other regions, or hymnals from other
churches from that region.) But it could also suggest that these authors were
participating in a local tradition. Perhaps Primitive Baptist congregations in
that place and time were beginning to sing in distinctive ways — preferring
major chords, using `IV` in major and `IV/III` in minor, becoming fond of
unanswered cadences — and these books' authors were echoing the new style in
their arrangements.


## Notes


[^1]: The Daily book was first published in 1902, and is still in print. It is available from the Primitive Baptist Library, http://www.pblib.org. It is the source of several popular songs reprinted in the _Shenandoah Harmony_ (CONFLICT is one of them) and is starting to be used in social singings by some Sacred Harp singers in the mid-Atlantic and New England.  

[^2]: LINKS

[^3]: This is especially dramatic in contrast to the harmonic tradition found in the Sacred Harp, where "minor"-key folk hymns are almost all in the dorian mode. The `IV` chord of the relative major (notated as `IV/III`) is based on the sixth scale degree; and so the dorian mode, which raises the sixth scale degree, makes that chord unavailable. One of the few exceptions is 271 ARKANSAS, a minor-key tune in the folk-hymn style which briefly features an open fifth "power chord" on `IV/III` (and is always sung in true minor rather than dorian), but it uses this chord very differently than Daily and company would have — it is part of a passage in which the bass follows the melody in parallel fifths. In the Daily book style, `IV/III` usually appears as part of traditional tonic-dominant-subdominant chord changes in the relative major, and parallel fifths of any sort are comparatively rare. The Makers of the Sacred Harp tells us the author of ARKANSAS was Shadrack Barnett of Carroll County, Georgia, who had no apparent connection to the arrangers discussed here.

[^4]: Unlike most reharmonizations in these books, where the tune is left mostly unaltered but the chords underneath it are changed, this version of STAR IN THE EAST converts the tune from minor to major by chromatic alteration, simply stripping out all of its flats. 

[^5]: It is possible that there is a common source that we still have not located for most of these arrangements — some fourth book that these three were drawing from. But it is unlikely that that fourth book would have included three different reharmonizations of IDUMEA, and that each of the three books we do have would have taken a different one. It is much more likely that each of the books we have was the original source for one reharmonization.

[^6]: Thomas Box Ausmus probably lived in Brown County, IL, due north of Saint Louis, up until 1899. We know this from church records: apparently Ausmus was ejected from his Brown County congregation in 1899 for taking up residence with a woman not his wife! ([An announcement of this was printed in the _Primitive Monitor_ in March 1899](https://books.google.com/books?id=R-QRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA190&lpg=PA190&dq=%22thomas+box+ausmus%22&source=bl&ots=A14dWRCuZJ&sig=xZ0v23GTpzPO3emuvmvJIJWTlBw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=j8lxVeSKJcqWygSMzYLQBA&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20box%20ausmus%22&f=false).) Daily's book is now published in Carthage, IL, which is tantalizingly close to Brown County — only 50 or so miles — but Daily himself was apparently more closely connected to Indianapolis. He is mentioned in connection with a debate in Ewing, Illinois, which is southeast of Saint Louis and 200 miles from Brown County. but [according to an obituary in the October 1920 _Primitive Monitor_, he was baptized in Clinton County, IN, and died in Indianapolis in 1920.](https://books.google.com/books?id=x3czAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=%22elder+john+r+daily%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sjdeHsDV3I&amp;sig=AxEZxefamQ7upDP6fkog6OB77vk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f35wVauLEZWiyAS704GQDw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22elder%20john%20r%20daily%22&amp;f=false) The original 1902 edition of his book was published in Indianapolis as well. Durand &amp; Lester's hymnal was also published in Indianapolis, though the authors were from farther east: Durand from Bucks County, PA, and Lester from Floyd County, VA.
